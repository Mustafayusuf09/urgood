## Quick Test Before Submission

### 1. Clean Build Test
```bash
cd /Users/mustafayusuf/urgood/urgood
xcodebuild clean build -scheme urgood -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15 Pro'
```

### 2. Voice Chat Test

- [ ] Tap to start
- [ ] Speak a test message
- [ ] Verify AI responds
- [ ] Check audio quality

### 3. Repository Test
```bash
# Test clone from scratch
cd /tmp
git clone [your-repo-url]
cd urgood
open urgood/urgood.xcodeproj
# Verify it opens without errors
```

## Final Commit Commands

```bash
cd /Users/mustafayusuf/urgood

# Stage all changes
git add .

# Commit with clear message
git commit -m "Fix: Voice chat audio buffer issue - Adjust VAD settings and buffer validation

- Lowered VAD threshold from 0.6 to 0.5 for better speech detection
- Increased silence duration from 900ms to 1200ms
- Added buffer duration validation before commit
- Prevents 0.00ms buffer error that was blocking voice responses
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging

This fix ensures voice chat captures full user speech before processing,
resolving the critical 'buffer too small' error that prevented AI responses."

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```
