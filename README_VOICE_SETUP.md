## 🎯 API Keys Location

### Development (Safe - in Xcode only)
```
urgood.xcodeproj/xcshareddata/xcschemes/urgood.xcscheme
└── EnvironmentVariables
    ├── ELEVENLABS_API_KEY = sk_ddd443c70c648dd0e000b1c3ad5ff17395637ea26d6c8534
    └── OPENAI_API_KEY = sk-proj-CbG6bOisK_9-91vOr0Kdy...
```

### Production (Secure - server-side only)
```
Firebase Functions Config
└── elevenlabs.key = sk_ddd443c70c648dd0e000b1c3ad5ff17395637ea26d6c8534
└── openai.key = sk-proj-CbG6bOisK_9-91vOr0Kdy...
```

**Keys are NEVER in the source code!** ✅

---

## 🔐 Security

### ✅ Best Practices Implemented
- API keys in environment variables (not code)
- Production keys server-side (Firebase Functions)
- `.gitignore` configured to exclude sensitive files
- Automatic fallback if ElevenLabs unavailable

### ⚠️ Never Do This
- ❌ Hardcode API keys in Swift files
- ❌ Commit `.xcscheme` with keys to public repos
- ❌ Share keys in screenshots/logs
- ❌ Use same keys for dev and prod
