## 🎯 Judge Setup Guide

### Option 1: Review Code Only (Recommended for Judges)
If you want to review the code without running the app:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/urgood.git
   cd urgood
   ```

2. **Browse the codebase**
   - Open `urgood/urgood.xcodeproj` in Xcode to view the iOS code
   - Key files are listed in the [For Hackathon Judges](#-for-hackathon-judges) section
   - Architecture is documented in the [Architecture](#-architecture) section

3. **Watch the demo video**
   - See the app in action without needing API keys
   - [Link to demo video]

### Option 2: Run the App (Requires API Keys)
To actually run and test the app, you'll need:

**Required API Keys:**
- **OpenAI API Key** - For chat and voice features ([Get one here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys))
- **Firebase Project** - For authentication and backend ([Setup guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup))

**Optional API Keys:**
- **ElevenLabs API Key** - For enhanced voice synthesis ([Get one here](https://elevenlabs.io/))
- **RevenueCat API Key** - For subscription management ([Get one here](https://www.revenuecat.com/))

**Setup Steps:**

1. **Clone and open the project**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/urgood.git
   cd urgood
   open urgood/urgood.xcodeproj
   ```

2. **Configure API keys**
   
   Create a file at `urgood/urgood/Secrets.xcconfig` with:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY = sk-your-openai-api-key-here
   ELEVENLABS_API_KEY = your-elevenlabs-key-here
   REVENUECAT_API_KEY = your-revenuecat-key-here
   ```

3. **Add Firebase configuration**
   - Download `GoogleService-Info.plist` from your Firebase project
   - Add it to `urgood/urgood/` directory in Xcode

4. **Select your development team**
   - In Xcode, select the project
   - Go to "Signing & Capabilities"
   - Choose your Apple Developer team

5. **Build and run**
   - Select a simulator or connected device
   - Press `Cmd + R`

**Note for Judges**: The app will work in a limited capacity without all API keys:
- ✅ UI and navigation fully functional
- ✅ Mood tracking and check-ins work offline
- ❌ Voice chat requires OpenAI API key
- ❌ Premium features require RevenueCat setup
