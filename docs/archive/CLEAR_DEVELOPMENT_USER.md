# 🧹 Clear Development User - Fix Instructions

## 🔍 **Problem**
The app is showing "Development User" and "dev@urgood.com" even though development mode is disabled. This is because there's a **cached Firebase user** from previous testing.

## 🛠️ **Quick Fix Options**

### **Option 1: Reset iOS Simulator (Recommended)**
1. **In iOS Simulator**: Device → Erase All Content and Settings
2. **Restart the app** - should now show proper authentication flow

### **Option 2: Sign Out Programmatically**
Add this temporary code to force sign out:

1. **In Xcode**, open `SafeContentView.swift`
2. **Add this to the `initializeApp()` method**:
```swift
private func initializeApp() {
    // TEMPORARY: Force sign out to clear cached user
    Task {
        try? await container.authService.signOut()
    }
    
    // ... rest of existing code
}
```

3. **Run the app once** - it will sign out the cached user
4. **Remove the code** after running once

### **Option 3: Clear Simulator Data**
1. **In Xcode**: Product → Clean Build Folder
2. **Delete derived data**: ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/urgood-*
3. **Reset simulator**: Device → Erase All Content and Settings

## 🎯 **Expected Result**

After clearing the cached user, you should see:
- ✅ **No "Development User"**
- ✅ **Proper authentication flow**
- ✅ **Real Apple Sign-In required**
- ✅ **Production mode active**

## 🔍 **Why This Happened**

1. During previous testing, a Firebase user was cached
2. Firebase persists authentication state across app launches
3. Even though development mode is disabled, the cached user remains
4. The app shows the cached user until explicitly signed out

## 🚀 **Verification**

After clearing, the console should show:
```
🚀 Production mode - all restrictions active
🔍 No existing Firebase user found
```

**Not this:**
```
🔍 Found existing Firebase user: dev@urgood.com
```

**The simplest fix is Option 1 - just reset the iOS Simulator!** 🎯
