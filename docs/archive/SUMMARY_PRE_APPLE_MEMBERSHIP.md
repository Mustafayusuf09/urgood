## üéâ WHAT WE JUST COMPLETED

### Critical Fixes Applied Today

1. **‚úÖ Fixed API Key in DIContainer**
   - **Before**: Hardcoded `"your-openai-api-key"`
   - **After**: Using `APIConfig.openAIAPIKey`
   - **File**: `urgood/urgood/App/DIContainer.swift` (line 50)

2. **‚úÖ Enabled Production Mode**
   - **Before**: All bypass flags were `true` (dev mode)
   - **After**: All bypass flags are `false` (production mode)
   - **File**: `urgood/urgood/Core/Config/DevelopmentConfig.swift`
   - **Impact**: App now requires:
     - ‚úÖ Authentication
     - ‚úÖ Paywall enforcement
     - ‚úÖ Onboarding flow

3. **‚úÖ Secured OpenAI API Key**
   - **Before**: Hardcoded API key
   - **After**: Supports environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` with fallback
   - **File**: `urgood/urgood/Core/Config/APIConfig.swift` (line 10)
   - **Production Note**: Key will work, but consider moving to secure vault
