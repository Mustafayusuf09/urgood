# UrGood App Icon

## Design Philosophy
Minimal, bold, and instantly recognizable - designed to work beautifully at all sizes and on both light and dark backgrounds.

### Colors
- **Primary**: Sky Blue (#4DA6FF) - representing trust, calm, and safety
- **Accent**: Soft Peach (#FFB997) - representing warmth, humanity, and care
- **Subtle Gradient**: Light to slightly deeper sky blue for depth

### Design Elements

1. **Chat Bubble**: A bold, rounded chat bubble shape
   - Represents communication, connection, and conversation
   - Soft rounded corners (25% radius) for approachability
   - Subtle shadow for Apple-style depth
   - Small tail at bottom left for classic chat bubble recognition

2. **4-Point Sparkle**: A peach-colored sparkle at the center
   - Represents positivity, hope, and the "magic" of connection
   - White highlight in center for extra visual pop
   - 4-point star design stays clear even at small sizes

3. **Accent Dots**: Three white dots around the sparkle
   - Represent magic, celebration, and positive energy
   - Add playfulness without cluttering
   - Positioned asymmetrically for dynamic feel

### Design Principles
✅ **Minimal & Bold** - Clear shapes that stay recognizable at 16px

✅ **Works on Both Backgrounds** - Sky blue pops on both light & dark iOS themes
