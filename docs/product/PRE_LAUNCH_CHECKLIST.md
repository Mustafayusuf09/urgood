## ‚ö†Ô∏è KNOWN LIMITATIONS & FUTURE WORK

### Current Limitations
1. **OpenAI API Key Security**: Currently using fallback hardcoded key. Consider:
   - Moving to Xcode build configuration
   - Using secure vault service
   - Implementing backend proxy for API calls

2. **Standalone Services**: App uses mock implementations for:
   - Authentication (StandaloneAuthService)
   - Billing (mock RevenueCat)
   - Need to replace with real services after membership

3. **No Backend**: Everything is local currently
   - Consider building backend API for:
     - User data sync across devices
     - Advanced analytics
     - Push notification triggers
     - AI response caching

### Post-Launch Improvements
- [ ] Add iCloud sync
- [ ] Build admin dashboard
- [ ] Implement referral program
- [ ] Add social sharing
- [ ] Create widgets
- [ ] Add Apple Watch app
- [ ] Implement daily quotes/tips
- [ ] Add meditation/breathing exercises
- [ ] Create therapist matching feature (future phase)

3. **Finish legal publishing, review documentation, and full device testing**

**Suggested Timeline (adjust as needed):**
- **Today**: Finish content assets, publish legal docs, create RevenueCat account
- **Tomorrow**: Execute simulator testing, finalize reviewer documentation, plan marketing
- **Next 2-3 Days**: Complete App Store Connect setup, provisioning, push, TestFlight build
- **Following Week**: Run TestFlight cycle, address feedback, submit for review
