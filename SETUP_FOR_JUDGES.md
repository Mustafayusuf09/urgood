# üéØ Quick Setup Guide for Hackathon Judges

## ‚ö° 5-Minute Setup to Test the App

I've funded API keys so you can test the full app functionality! Follow these steps:

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/urgood.git
cd urgood
```

### Step 2: Get the API Keys
**I've provided funded API keys for judges to test the app.**

üìß **Email me for the API keys**: [your-email@example.com]

Or check the hackathon submission platform for the keys file.

### Step 3: Configure the Keys

1. **Create the secrets file**:
   ```bash
   cd urgood/urgood
   cp Secrets.xcconfig.template Secrets.xcconfig
   ```

2. **Edit `Secrets.xcconfig`** with the provided keys:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY = sk-proj-[provided-key]
   ELEVENLABS_API_KEY = [provided-key]
   REVENUECAT_API_KEY = [provided-key]
   ```

### Step 4: Add Firebase Config

1. I've included a `GoogleService-Info.plist` file in the repo for judges
2. If it's missing, email me and I'll send it

### Step 5: Open and Run

```bash
open urgood/urgood.xcodeproj
```

In Xcode:
1. Select your development team in "Signing & Capabilities"
2. Choose a simulator (iPhone 15 Pro recommended)
3. Press `Cmd + R` to build and run

### Step 6: Test Voice Chat

1. Tap "Chat" in the bottom navigation
2. Tap the microphone button to start voice chat
3. Speak: "I'm feeling stressed about my exams"
4. Wait for the AI to respond (should be 1-2 seconds)
5. Continue the conversation naturally
